## 🧠 What Are Dependencies?

A **dependency** is a library or package that your project needs to run.
Example:
```python
import fastapi
import numpy
```
Your code depends on `fastapi` and `numpy`. Without them, it will crash.

## 🧩 The Problem Without Virtual Environments

Installing packages globally (system-wide):
- Causes **version conflicts** between projects.
- Makes **reproducibility difficult**.
- Leads to **dependency hell**.

Example conflict:

```
Project A → Django==4.2
Project B → Django==3.2
```

You can’t have both globally.

---

## 🧩 Virtual Environments (venv)

A **virtual environment** creates an **isolated sandbox** for each project — its own Python interpreter and dependencies.
### 🧱 Steps

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

✅ Packages are installed inside `venv/`, not globally.
🧠 Use `requirements.txt` to freeze dependencies:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
Recreate later:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧩 Dependency Management

### Definition

> Keeping track of which libraries (and versions) your project uses — installing, upgrading, locking, and reproducing them consistently.

### Goals
- Install and upgrade dependencies easily.
- Lock exact versions to ensure consistency.
- Recreate environment anywhere.
- Avoid version conflicts.

### Manual (venv + pip)

```bash
pip install fastapi==0.111.0 uvicorn==0.30.0
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Later:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧩 Poetry — Modern Dependency Management

**Poetry** handles:

- Virtual environments
- Dependency resolution (version compatibility)
- Version locking (`poetry.lock`)
- Project metadata (`pyproject.toml`)
- Packaging and publishing

### Example Workflow

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry new my_project
cd my_project
poetry add fastapi uvicorn
poetry shell
```

### Files

📄 `pyproject.toml` 
- it lists only **top-level dependencies** (the ones _you explicitly added_).
- it doesn’t list FastAPI’s internal dependencies

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.12"
fastapi = "^0.111.0"
uvicorn = "^0.30.0"
```

📄 `poetry.lock`

This file is the **resolved dependency graph** — it contains:
- Every direct dependency (like `fastapi`, `uvicorn`)
- Every **transitive (indirect) dependency** (like `pydantic`, `starlette`, etc.)
- Their **exact versions** and **inter-dependencies**

```
fastapi==0.111.0
uvicorn==0.30.0
pydantic==2.6.1
```

Recreate anywhere:

```bash
poetry install
```

## 🧩 Comparison — venv vs Poetry

|Feature|venv|Poetry|
|---|---|---|
|Creates isolated env|✅|✅|
|Installs dependencies|Manual (pip)|Automatic (poetry add)|
|Tracks versions|`requirements.txt`|`poetry.lock`|
|Handles dependency conflicts|❌|✅|
|Project metadata|❌|✅ (`pyproject.toml`)|
|Build/publish package|❌|✅|
|Simplicity|🟢 Simple|🟠 Slightly more complex|
|Ideal for|Small scripts|Full apps / production|

## 🧩 Why Dependency Management Matters

|Problem|Solution|
|---|---|
|"Works on my machine"|Reproducible env (locked versions)|
|Broken updates|Version pinning|
|Complex dependencies|Automatic resolution|
|New developer onboarding|One command install|
|Deployments|Reliable, consistent builds|

## 🧩 How Poetry Handles Dependency Conflicts

Poetry includes a **dependency resolver** that checks the entire dependency graph for version compatibility **before** installing anything.

Example conflict:

```
fastapi → pydantic >=2.6.0
some_library → pydantic <2.0
```

Poetry will detect the conflict and stop installation with a clear error message:

```
Because some_library (1.0.0) depends on pydantic (<2.0)
 and fastapi (0.111.0) depends on pydantic (>=2.6.1),
 version solving failed.
```

✅ This prevents hidden incompatibilities.

Poetry’s resolver:

1. Builds a full dependency graph.
2. Finds compatible versions that satisfy all constraints.
3. Fails early if impossible.
4. Locks successful resolutions in `poetry.lock`.
    

---

## 🧩 The Role of `poetry.lock` and Dependency Resolution

|Action|Uses `poetry.lock`|Runs Resolver|
|---|---|---|
|`poetry install` (no changes)|✅|❌|
|`poetry add package`|❌|✅|
|`poetry update`|❌|✅|
|Clone repo + install|✅|❌|

- The **resolver** runs whenever dependencies change.
- The **lock file** stores the final resolved result (exact versions).

`pyproject.toml` = declares _what you want_ (top-level deps).  
`poetry.lock` = records _what works_ (exact resolved versions).

Think of it like a recipe and shopping list analogy:

- `pyproject.toml`: “I need butter, sugar, and flour.”
- `poetry.lock`: “Butter (brand X), Sugar (brand Y)”
    

---

---

## ✅ TL;DR

- **venv** → isolates dependencies only. You manage versions manually.
- **poetry** → isolates + resolves + locks dependencies automatically.
- **`poetry.lock`** stores exact versions and interdependencies.
- **Resolver** re-runs whenever dependencies change.
