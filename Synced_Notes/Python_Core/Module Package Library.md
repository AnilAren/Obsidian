|---|---|---|---|
|**Module**|Single `.py` file|`math_utils.py`|Small reusable code unit|
|**Package**|Folder with `__init__.py`|`myapp/`|Group of related modules|
|**Library**|Collection of packages|`requests`, `numpy`|Complete reusable toolkit|

> **Module** = one `.py` file  
> **Package** = folder of modules  
> **Library** = collection of packages


## If i have a project with multiple pacakages and modules like tenant, model and other what will this be

If your project has **multiple packages and modules** (like `tenant`, `model`, `utils`, etc.),  
then your **project as a whole** is considered a **Python library** or **application package** —  
depending on whether you’re exposing it for reuse or building it for internal use.

| Reusable Python codebase (tenant/model/utils etc.)     | **Python package / library**         | Structured for modular imports, can be published or reused.         |
| Deployed code exposing endpoints (e.g. FastAPI/Flask)  | **API service / microservice**       | Your project is a web service layer using your packages internally. |
| If it wraps OpenAI API logic for other services        | **Integration service**              | It mediates between OpenAI and internal apps.                       |
| If it has multiple such services (tenant, model, etc.) | **Distributed service architecture** | Multi-module project with clear service boundaries.                 |



**A modular AI gateway service** (or **LLM orchestration layer**) that exposes OpenAI-compatible REST endpoints and routes SDK requests to internal or external model backends.
