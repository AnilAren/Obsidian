## What is a Thread?

A **thread** is the **smallest unit of [[Utils#Execution|execution]]**** within a process([[Utils#What is a **Process**?]]).

When you run a Python program, it starts with **one main thread** â€” the one that executes your code.  
But you can create **additional threads** to perform multiple tasks _seemingly_ at the same time.

All threads:
- Belong to the **same process**.
- **Share the same memory space**.
- Can **access the same variables and objects** (but need synchronization to avoid conflicts).


#### Example:
A **thread** is like a **mini-task** that runs **inside a process**.

Think of a **process** as a _factory_, and **threads** as _workers_ inside that factory.  
All workers share the same tools and workspace (memory), but they can work on **different parts of the job at the same time**.

## What is Multithreading?

**Multithreading** means running **multiple threads concurrently** within a single process.

Python uses the `threading` module for this.

ðŸ’¡ However â€” because of the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** [[Utils#GIL]], only **one thread** executes Python bytecode at a time, even if you have multiple CPU cores(4 CPU cores mean we can run 4 threads simulattenusly).

So, Python multithreading is **concurrent**, not truly **parallel**.

## When is Multithreading Useful?

ðŸ‘‰ **I/O-bound tasks** â€” where the program spends most time waiting (like reading files, calling APIs, or database access).

Because while one thread waits for I/O, another can continue running.
## Key Properties of Threads

| Property                   | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared Memory**          | All threads share global variables â€” but this can lead to race conditions.                         |
| **Lightweight**            | Threads use less memory and start faster than processes.                                           |
| **Synchronization Needed** | You must use locks (`threading.Lock()`) to avoid data corruption.                                  |
| **Single GIL**             | Only one thread runs Python bytecode at a time â€” true parallelism not achieved for CPU-heavy work. |
